# Track Tracker
Recognition of video data using a trained convolutional neural network

## Introduction

The Track Tracker application (track_tracker.py) provides extended running statistics for runners. Using recorded video data of one's running activity, the Track Tracker calculates (1) the asphalt ratio and (2) forest ratio of a running activity.

The asphalt ratio gives the percentage of the running activity that was performed on an asphalt track.

The forst ratio gives the percentage of the running activity that was performed in a forest environment. 

A streamlit app can be used to display the total summary of one's running activities on asphalt tracks and forest tracks.
